    There should be a maxpool after each convolution.
    The sequence of operations looks like this:
        1. Apply convolutional layer with stride and kernel size specified
            - note: uses hard-coded in_channels and out_channels
            - read the problems to figure out what these should be!
        2. Apply the activation function (ReLU)
        3. Apply 2D max pooling with a kernel size of 2
    Inputs:
    kernel_size: list of length 2 containing kernel sizes for the two convolutional layers
                 e.g., kernel_size = [(3,3), (3,3)]
    stride: list of length 2 containing strides for the two convolutional layers
