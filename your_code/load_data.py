    Loads MNIST files into a 3D numpy array. Does not automatically download
    the dataset. You must download the dataset manually. The data can be
    downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

    Examples:
        1) Assuming that you have downloaded the MNIST database in a directory
        called 'data', this will load all images and labels from the training
        set:

            images, labels = _load_mnist('training')

        2) And this will load 100 sevens from the test partition:

            sevens = _load_mnist('testing', digits=[7], selection=slice(0, 100),
                                return_labels=False)

    Arguments:
        path - (str) Path to your MNIST datafiles.
        dataset - (str) Either "training" or "testing". The data partition to
            load.
        digits - (list or None) A list of integers specifying the digits to
            load. If None, the entire database is loaded.
        asbytes - (bool) If True, returns data as ``numpy.uint8`` in [0, 255]
            as opposed to ``numpy.float64`` in [0.0, 1.0].
        selection - (slice) Using a `slice` object, specify what subset of the
            dataset to load. An example is ``slice(0, 20, 2)``, which would
            load every other digit until--but not including--the twentieth.
        return_labels - (bool) Specify whether or not labels should be
            returned. This is also a speed performance if digits are not
            specified, since then the labels file does not need to be read at
            all.
        return_indicies - (bool) Specify whether or not to return the MNIST
            indices that were fetched. This is valuable only if digits is
            specified, because in that case it can be valuable to know how far
            in the database it reached.
    Returns:
        images - (np.array) Image data of shape ``(N, rows, cols)``, where
            ``N`` is the number of images. If neither labels nor indices are
            returned, then this is returned directly, and not inside a 1-sized
            tuple.
        labels - (np.array) Array of size ``N`` describing the labels.
            Returned only if ``return_labels`` is `True`, which is default.
        indices - (np.array) The indices in the database that were returned.
