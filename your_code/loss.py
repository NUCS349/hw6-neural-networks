class Loss(object):
    """
    An abstract base class for a loss function that computes both the original
    loss function (the forward pass) as well as its gradient (the backward
    pass).

    Arguments:
        regularization - (Regularization or None) The type of regularization to
            perform. Either a derived class of Regularization or None. If None,
            no regularization is performed.

        Computes the forward pass through the loss function. If
        self.regularization is not None, also adds the forward pass of the
        regularization term to the loss.

        Arguments:
            X - (np.array) An Nx(d+1) array of features, where N is the number
                of examples and d is the number of features. The +1 refers to
                the bias term.
            w - (np.array) A 1D array of parameters of length d+1. The current
                parameters learned by the model. The +1 refers to the bias
                term.
            y - (np.array) A 1D array of targets of length N.

        Computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model

        pass of the regularization term to the loss.
